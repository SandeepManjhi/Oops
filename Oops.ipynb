        "Q.1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects and classes. It provides a way to structure and organize code using objects that have properties and behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main principles of OOP include:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit.\n",
        "  2. Abstraction: Hiding internal details and showing only the necessary information to the outside world.\n",
        "  3. Inheritance: Creating a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and behaviors.\n",
        "  4. Polymorphism: Allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP provides several benefits, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Modularity: Breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable parts.\n",
        "  - Reusability: Reusing code and reducing duplication.\n",
        "  - Easier maintenance: Modifying and extending code without affecting other parts of the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using OOP, developers can create more efficient, scalable, and maintainable software systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - Class in OOP: A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behaviors of an object. It's a design pattern or template that defines the characteristics of an object, including its:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Attributes (data): The characteristics or properties of the object.\n",
        "    - Methods (functions): The actions that the object can perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "A class is essentially a template for creating objects that share similar properties and behaviors. It defines the structure and behavior of an object, and objects created from a class are instances of that class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - Object in OOP: An object is an instance of a class, which has its own set of attributes (data) and methods (functions). Objects represent real-world entities or concepts and have their own state and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key characteristics of an object:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - State: Defined by its attributes (data)\n",
        "  - Behavior: Defined by its methods (functions)\n",
        "  - Identity: Each object has a unique identity\n",
        "\n",
        "Objects can interact with each other and respond to changes in their environment, making them a fundamental building block of object-oriented programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Abstraction vs Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstraction: Focuses on hiding internal implementation details and showing only the necessary information to the outside world.\n",
        "- Encapsulation: Focuses on bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, controlling access and modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider a TV remote control:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstraction: You don't need to know how the TV works internally to change channels or adjust volume. You just press buttons. This is abstraction.\n",
        "- Encapsulation: The TV's internal components (e.g., circuit boards, wires) are bundled together and controlled through the remote control interface (buttons). You can't directly access the internal components. This is encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstraction makes it easy to use the TV without knowing its internal workings.\n",
        "- Encapsulation protects the TV's internal components and ensures they work together seamlessly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods, short for \"double underscore\" methods, are special methods in Python that are surrounded by double underscores (__) on either side of the method name. They are used for:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Operator overloading: Defining custom behavior for operators like +, -, *, etc.\n",
        "2. Object initialization and representation: Defining how objects are created, represented, and stringified.\n",
        "3. Special behaviors: Defining custom behavior for built-in functions like len(), str(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of dunder methods include:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - __init__: Initializes an object\n",
        "  - __str__: Returns a string representation of an object\n",
        "  - __repr__: Returns a formal representation of an object\n",
        "  - __add__: Defines behavior for the + operator\n",
        "  - __len__: Defines behavior for the len() function\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "  - Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key aspects:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Parent class (or superclass): The class being inherited from.\n",
        "  2. Child class (or subclass): The class that inherits from the parent class.\n",
        "  3. Inheritance: The child class inherits the attributes and methods of the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Code reuse: Inheritance allows to reuse code from the parent class.\n",
        "  2. Hierarchical relationships: Inheritance helps model hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
        "  3. Easier maintenance: Changes to the parent class can be automatically reflected in the child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose you have a Vehicle class (parent) and a Car class (child). The Car class can inherit the properties and behavior of the Vehicle class, such as color, speed, and accelerate(). The Car class can also add its own specific properties and behavior, such as num_doors and open_trunk().\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms, depending on the context in which it is used. This allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key aspects:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Method overriding: A subclass provides a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "  2. Method overloading: Multiple methods with the same name can be defined, but with different parameters.\n",
        "  3. Operator overloading: Operators like +, -, *, etc. can be redefined for custom classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Increased flexibility: Polymorphism allows for more generic code, making it easier to write programs that can work with different data types.\n",
        "  2. Easier maintenance: Changes to the code can be made at a single place, reducing the effort required to maintain the code.\n",
        "  3. More intuitive: Polymorphism allows for more natural and intuitive code, making it easier to understand and use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose you have a Shape class with subclasses Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. You can define a draw() method in the Shape class and override it in each subclass to provide a specific implementation. This way, you can treat objects of different shapes as Shape objects and call the draw() method on them, without knowing their actual class type.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation in Python is achieved through the use of:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Classes: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit.\n",
        "    2. Access modifiers: Python uses naming conventions to indicate the intended level of access:\n",
        "        - Public attributes: No underscore prefix (e.g., attribute).\n",
        "        - Protected attributes: Single underscore prefix (e.g., _attribute).\n",
        "        - Private attributes: Double underscore prefix (e.g., __attribute).\n",
        "    3. Properties: Using the @property decorator to control access to attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class BankAccount:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        self.__balance = 0.0\n",
        "\n",
        "    @property\n",
        "    def balance(self):\n",
        "        return self.__balance\n",
        "\n",
        "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
        "        self.__balance += amount\n",
        "\n",
        "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
        "        if amount > self.__balance:\n",
        "            raise ValueError(\"Insufficient funds\")\n",
        "        self.__balance -= amount\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The __balance attribute is private, and its access is controlled through the balance property.\n",
        "  - The deposit and withdraw methods modify the __balance attribute while enforcing business logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - A constructor in Python is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the attributes of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Constructor syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the constructor is defined using the __init__ method:\n",
        "\n",
        "class ClassName:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    def __init__(self, parameter1, parameter2, ...):\n",
        "        # initialization code here\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "The constructor is used to:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Initialize attributes with default or provided values.\n",
        "  2. Set up the object's state.\n",
        "  3. Perform any necessary setup or initialization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "person = Person(\"John\", 30)\n",
        "print(person.name)  # Output: John\n",
        "print(person.age)   # Output: 30\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the __init__ method is called when a new Person object is created, initializing the name and age attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, we can define two types of methods that belong to a class rather than an instance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Class methods:\n",
        "    - Defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "    - Take the class itself as the first argument (usually named cls).\n",
        "    - Can access or modify class state.\n",
        "    - Can be used as an alternative constructor.\n",
        "2. Static methods:\n",
        "    - Defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "    - Do not take any implicit first argument (neither self nor cls).\n",
        "    - Cannot access or modify class or instance state.\n",
        "    - Used for utility functions that belong to the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class MyClass:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    count = 0\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        MyClass.count += 1\n",
        "\n",
        "    @classmethod\n",
        "    def get_count(cls):\n",
        "        return cls.count\n",
        "\n",

        "    def is_valid_input(input_value):\n",
        "        return isinstance(input_value, int)\n",
        "\n",
        "obj1 = MyClass()\n",
        "\n",
        "obj2 = MyClass()\n",
        "\n",
        "print(MyClass.get_count())  # Output: 2\n",
        "\n",
        "print(MyClass.is_valid_input(10))  # Output: True\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The get_count class method accesses the class attribute count.\n",
        "- The is_valid_input static method is a utility function that checks if the input is an integer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Class methods are useful for managing class state or providing alternative constructors, while static methods are useful for grouping related utility functions within a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - Method overloading isn't supported directly in Python, but it can be access using *args:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Default argument values: Providing default values for some or all parameters.\n",
        "2. Variable argument lists: Using *args and **kwargs to accept variable numbers of arguments.\n",
        "3. Single dispatch: Using the @singledispatch decorator from the functools module to define a single function that can handle different types of arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example using default argument values:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Calculator:\n",
        "    def calculate(self, a, b, operation=\"add\"):\n",
        "        if operation == \"add\":\n",
        "            return a + b\n",
        "        elif operation == \"subtract\":\n",
        "            return a - b\n",
        "        else:\n",

        "\n",
        "calculator = Calculator()\n",
        "print(calculator.calculate(10, 5))  # Output: 15\n",
        "print(calculator.calculate(10, 5, \"subtract\"))  # Output: 5\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the calculate method has a default value for the operation parameter, allowing it to behave differently based on the provided arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "While Python does not support traditional method overloading, these approaches provide flexible ways to achieve similar functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - Method overriding is a feature in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key aspects:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Same method name: The subclass method has the same name as the superclass method.\n",
        "  2. Same method signature: The subclass method has the same parameters as the superclass method.\n",
        "  3. Different implementation: The subclass method provides a different implementation than the superclass method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits:\n",

        "\n",
        "Q.13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - The @property decorator in Python allows to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for an attribute, enabling to control access to the attribute and perform actions when it is accessed or modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "\n",

        "Q.14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism is crucial in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Increases flexibility: Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "    2. Enhances modularity: Enables writing code that can work with different data types without knowing their specific class type.\n",
        "    3. Improves code reuse: Facilitates code reuse by allowing the same code to work with different objects.\n",
        "    4. Simplifies code maintenance: Makes it easier to add new functionality or modify existing code without affecting other parts of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Easier to extend: Polymorphism makes it easier to add new classes or functionality without modifying existing code.\n",
        "  2. More generic code: Enables writing more generic code that can work with a wide range of data types.\n",
        "  3. Better abstraction: Helps to abstract away specific implementation details, making code more modular and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "A graphics program can use polymorphism to treat different shapes (e.g., circles, rectangles, triangles) as Shape objects, allowing for more flexibility and code reuse when drawing or manipulating shapes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is designed to be inherited by other classes. It provides a blueprint for other classes to follow and can include both abstract methods (methods without implementation) and concrete methods (methods with implementation).\n",
        "\n",
        "Key aspects:\n",
